How many times, we found marvelouns information on video, but, BUT, when we start to see that media, KAPUT, the voice audio accent destroys ours ears; that's not meaning I have a great accent, in English Language, maybe for those with those accents, WE HAVE THE WORST... but, I want to AI and NVIDIA Workbench comes to rescue MY DAMAGED EARs, period. 

No body was hurt in the making of this project.
